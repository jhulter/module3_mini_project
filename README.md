# module3_mini_project

Copy and paste the code into whatever IDE you are using and hit run. You'll be shown a menu to choose from, hit the corresponding number for the action you wish to accomplish. Most should be pretty straitforward. I left the import function commented out for now but I might go back and attempt it. For the export function the dictionary of contacts will be exported into a file in the current working directory, so it will appear alongside the main.py file.

I don't think I missed anything but let me know and I'll circle back and fix any issues I may have missed, but for the most part I felt pretty confident and happy with my work. Thanks!
